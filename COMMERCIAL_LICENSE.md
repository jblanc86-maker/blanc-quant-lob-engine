# Commercial License Terms (Summary)

Production use (live trading, order routing, broker/exchange integration, market making, or deployment in revenue‑generating workflows) prior to the Change Date requires a commercial license from the Licensor. The Business Source License 1.1 permits non‑production research, evaluation, benchmarking, education, and internal prototyping immediately and converts to Apache‑2.0 on the Change Date.

Key points (non‑exhaustive):

- Production includes: live trading, production order routing, market making, broker/exchange integrations, customer‑facing services, or internal systems whose reliability materially impacts revenue.
- Non‑production research, evaluation, benchmarking, education, and internal prototypes are permitted without a commercial license before the Change Date.
- Change Date: 24 months after the first public release tag (see `LICENSE`).
- Change License: Apache‑2.0.

See `LICENSE` (BUSL‑1.1 parameters) for authoritative terms.

# Commercial License Terms (Summary)

For production use in live trading or any other revenue-generating systems, a commercial license from the Licensor is required until the Change Date. The Business Source License 1.1 permits research and non‑commercial evaluation immediately and converts to Apache‑2.0 on the Change Date.

Key points (non‑exhaustive):

- Production includes: live trading, production order routing, market making, broker/exchange integrations, or deployment within revenue‑generating workflows.
- Research and evaluation use are permitted without a commercial license prior to the Change Date.
- On the Change Date (24 months after the first public release tag), the code converts to Apache‑2.0.

To inquire about commercial licensing, please open a private contact via GitHub (Issues with “Private” label, if enabled) or provide your preferred contact channel in an Issue template. Do not include sensitive details in public issues.

See `LICENSE` (BUSL‑1.1 parameters) for authoritative terms.

If the Licensor offers an additional warranty, that will be stated separately.

The Licensor may make conditional grants for a production use of the Licensed Work under a separate commercial license. Production use includes use of the Licensed Work in a revenue-generating environment, in trading or order routing, in market making, in customer-facing systems, or in workflows where availability, correctness, and performance characteristics materially impact downstream operations.

If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.

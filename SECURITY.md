# Security Policy

Thank you for helping keep this project and its users safe.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

- Preferred: Use GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting (Security tab → “Report a vulnerability”). This sends a private report to the maintainers.
- If private reporting is unavailable, open a draft GitHub Security Advisory (Security tab → Advisories → “New draft advisory”).
- As a last resort, create a new issue with the title starting with "[SECURITY]" and minimal details, asking for a secure contact channel. Do not include exploit details in public issues.

Please include:

- A clear description of the issue and impact
- Steps to reproduce or a proof-of-concept
- Affected commit/branch and environment details

## Supported Versions

Security fixes are provided for the latest main branch and the most recent tagged release when applicable. Older versions may not receive fixes.

## Response Timeline

- Acknowledge receipt within 3 business days
- Provide an initial assessment within 7 business days
- Coordinate on a remediation plan and target release

These timelines are goals, not guarantees.

## Disclosure and Credit

We follow coordinated disclosure. We’ll notify downstream users as needed and credit reporters in release notes unless you prefer to remain anonymous.

## Scope

- In scope: Code and configuration in this repository.
- Out of scope: Third‑party dependencies, forks you maintain, or deployments you operate. For dependency issues, please also report upstream.

## Safe Harbor

We will not pursue legal action for good‑faith security research that:

- Respects user privacy and data integrity
- Avoids service disruption or data exfiltration
- Uses only the minimum necessary access to demonstrate the issue
- Gives us a reasonable time to remediate before public disclosure

If you have any questions about this policy, open a minimal issue requesting clarification.

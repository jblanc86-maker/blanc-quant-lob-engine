Binary capture -> replay harness -> orderbook -> detectors/breaker -> digest

Legend:
  - Binary capture (data/golden/itch_1m.bin)
  - Replay harness: C++20, cache-friendly
  - Order-book core: SoA
  - Detectors + Breaker gates: runtime safeguards
  - Digest: deterministic end-state hash
  - Latency metrics: p50/p90/p99
  - Publish mode: run summary and outputs

Flow:
  [data/golden/itch_1m.bin] -> [replay harness] -> [order-book core]
    -> [detectors + breaker gates] -> {digest, latency metrics, publish summary}

Artifacts:
  - artifacts/bench.jsonl   # bench per-run JSON lines
  - artifacts/metrics.prom  # prometheus textfile metrics
  - stdout run summary

If you need a nicer visual than Mermaid, copy this ASCII as a fallback in README or docs.
